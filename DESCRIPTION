Description: Rust-accelerated Bayesian genomic prediction methods (BayesR and BayesA) 
    for multi-allelic markers. Implements both Markov Chain Monte Carlo 
    (MCMC) sampling for full posterior inference and stochastic Expectation-Maximization 
    (EM) algorithms for efficient maximum likelihood estimation. Supports mixture-based 
    variable selection (BayesR) and marker-specific variance modeling (BayesA). Designed 
    for genomic selection in breeding programs.
